# RAG Agent

## Overview
This repo contains **two RAG agent implementations**:

1. **Static RAG Agent** – Works on preloaded documents and embeddings.  
2. **Live-Stream RAG Agent** – Handles incoming data dynamically.

## Purpose
Starting with a static agent allows us to **establish and validate the workflow** data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation before extending it to handle **live streaming data**.
This is done to understand the workflow and then extending it to work on live streams of data.
